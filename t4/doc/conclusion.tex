\section{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}
In this fourth laboratory assignment, all the major goals of the project were achieved. We concluded with success a further interaction with a new software (Ubuntu), with a simulation software (Ngspice), with a computational language program (GNU Octave) and with a text report editor (LaTeX). The construction and analysis of the circuit was also finished with success through simulation and theoretical interpretation, which allowed a good comparative analysis between the differences presented in the behaviour of a simulated and theoretical electric circuit. 

Even though the simulation results didnÂ´t match the theoretical results precisely, by the analysis of the percentual relative errors, we can say, in fact, this assignment was very helpful in the sense that we were able to build an Audio Amplifier circuit which allowed us to get a better understanding of how this type of circuits work.
