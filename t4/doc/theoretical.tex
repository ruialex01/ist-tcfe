\paragraph{}When it comes to this amplifier, it is exactly of the same type of the first one mentioned in the introduction, it is the circuit of a speaker. As such, the objective of this lab assignment is to build a circuit that has an input source of  $10mV$ and an output speaker of $8\Omega$.

\paragraph{}In very broad terms, this circuit is going to be divided in two: a gain stage, that will amplify the input sound signal as much as possible, and an output stage, which will make the amplifier's output impedance compatible with impedance of the speaker.
