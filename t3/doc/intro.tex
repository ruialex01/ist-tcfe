The objective of this laboratory assignment is to 
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.


\paragraph{}
In Section~\ref{sec:theoretical}, a theoretical introduction is made in order to contextualize all the main principles that sustain our analysis of the circuit. This circuit is carefully analysed in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, where the results are obtained in GNU Octave. Also, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation through the use of NGSpice to simulate the electric circuit behaviour. The results of the simulation of Section~\ref{sec:simulation} are then compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis} and the comparative results are expressed in Section~\ref{sec:erroranalysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in the final part of the report, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
