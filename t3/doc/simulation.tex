\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

\paragraph{}
In this section, we can find the results of each topic required in the simulation analysis. The numeric results or graphics are presented alongside a short explanation of the interpretation of the problem. All of the results were obatined usig NGSpice and the section is dividid in five different subsections 

\paragraph{}
Ngspice is a circuit-simulation program that makes it possible to have an accurate representation of how the circuit would behave if it was actually assembled. The different tables shown below ilustrate the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis. As it can be seen, the tables show the values of the voltage in all nodes, the currents in all of the branches and also the currents in independent voltage sources.
