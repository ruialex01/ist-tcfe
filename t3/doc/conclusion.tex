\paragraph{}
In this third laboratory assignment, all the major goals of the project were achieved. We concluded with success a further interaction with a new software (Ubuntu), with a simulation software (Ngspice), with a computational language program (GNU Octave) and with a text report editor (LaTeX). The construction and analysis of the circuit was also finished with success through simulation and theoretical interpretation, which allowed a good comparative analysis between the differences presented in the behaviour of a simulated and theoretical electric circuit. 

In fact, this assignment allowed us to build two AC-DC converters which were able to transform the current and achieve an output voltage as close to $12v$ as possible. Even though we needed to construct two different electric circuits according to the simulation or theoretical principles we were based on, both of them were succesfuly implemented and achieved the pretended output voltage. 
The simulation results abou the output voltage matched the theoretical results precisely. This accuracy was confirmed by the matemathical calculation of relative errors, which were proved to be really small. Also, the comparative analysis of graphics ploted by both theoretical and simulation tools confirmed the similarity of the results, obtained successfully and with notorious precision.
