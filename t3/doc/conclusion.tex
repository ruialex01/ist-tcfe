\paragraph{}
In this second laboratory assignment, all the major goals of the project were achieved. We concluded with success a further interaction with a new software (Ubuntu), with a simulation platform (Ngspice), with a computational language program (GNU Octave) and with a text report editor (LaTeX). The analysis of the circuit was also finished with success through simulation and theoretical interpretation, which allowed a good comparative analysis between these two methods.
