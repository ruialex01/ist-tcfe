********************************************
In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been achieved. Static,
time and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths
tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theo-
retical results precisely. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward
circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models cannot dif-
fer. For more complex components, the theoretical and simulation models could differ but this
is not the case in this work.
